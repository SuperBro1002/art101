		<h1> Hello World! </h1>
		<p> My name is Peter and I'm a 4th year AGPM transfer student! I'm interested in both 
			game design and graphic design. I've taken a few coding classes before, though 
			I'm far from an expert. In my free time I enjoy playing games and hanging out 
			with friends. My partner is Ashley. She likes dino nuggies.</p>
